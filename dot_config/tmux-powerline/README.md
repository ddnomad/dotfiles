Tmux Powerline
==============

Current setup is rather junky and requires the following things to fully work:

1. [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) installed
2. `<Prefix>+I` executed within Tmux to install Tmux Powerline plugin
3. `~/.config/tmux-powerline/patch.sh` executed to patch some of the hardcoded Tmux Powerline segment styles
