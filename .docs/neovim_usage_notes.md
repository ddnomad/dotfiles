- Added [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary). Use it with
  `gc` (toggle comment line), selection + `gc` (toggle comment a selected block
  ).
- Added [ctrlp.vom](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim). No extra
  configuration was performed. Use `Ctrl+P` to search for a file and open in
  a current buffer. Worth keeping?
- Added [ncm2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2) autocompletion and some
  completion providers. Currently it is annoying vvv much. Might be worth
  trying to get used to it.
- Added [SimpylFold](https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold). Use `zc` to
  fold all, `zi` to unfold all, `za` to toggle fold of a selected fold,
  `zA` to toggle fold and all nested folds.
