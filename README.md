> **NOTE**: This is an early development version of dd's dotfiles powered by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). Nothing works just yet and may not work for a very long time (potentially, forever).

## Quick Start

Make sure [Cargo Make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make.git) is installed in the host, then run the following commands from the project root directory:

```shell
makers init
```
