Firefox Custom Stylesheets
==========================
The main objective is to get rid of a builtin tabbar in favour of using
[TreeStyleTabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)
extension.

The majority of stylesheets were taking from
[firefox-csshacks](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks/tree/master/chrome)
repository with minor tweaks.
