# Arch Dotfiles
No comments just yet. Still WIP pretty much.

# Gotchas
* In order to force nerd-fonts to display properly a specific fork of
`rxvt-unicode` should be installed. Specifically: `rxvt-unicode-wcwidthcallback`
* To prevent esoteric bs happening with i3vm tiles focusing when using
`unclutter`, its fork should be installed `unclutter-xfixes-git`
